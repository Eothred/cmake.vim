ABOUT                                              *cmake-about*

CMake is a "Cross-Platform Makefile generator". However, CMake can generate
more than Makefiles; including Eclipse and KDevelop build systems, making it
quite diverse in its output.

The act of integrating CMake with Vim allows for developers to use the
facilities of CMake without having to constantly switch back and forth. This
plugin goes a step further and automatically sets 'makeprg' for you to help
other tools related to Java, C++, C, Objective C or Fortan-based programming
easily invoke CMake's version of the build system.

'cmake' version 0.1.6 provides this integration with minimal effort to the
developer using Vim.

2. QUICK START ~
                                                    *cmake-quickstart*
Ensure that you have a working (discoverable in '$PATH' by Vim) version of
CMake. You can check that CMake is invokable by Vim by running the following
command: >

  !cmake --version

You should get output similar to the following: >

  cmake version 2.8.10.1


3. OPTIONS ~

The options described are reflected with their default values.

3.1. C++ COMPILER ~
                     *cmake-options-cxx-compiler* *cmake-options-cpp-compiler*
>
  let g:cmake_cxx_compiler = 'clang++'

Defines the C++ compiler that CMake will use. 

3.2. C99 COMPILER ~

                        *cmake-options-c-compiler* *cmake-options-c99-compiler*
>
  let g:cmake_c_compiler = 'clang'

Defines the C compiler that CMake will use.

3.3. BUILD DIRECTORIES ~
                                                    *cmake-options-build-dirs*
>
  let g:cmake_build_dirs = [ "build" ]

Defines a list of the names of directories to search for 'CMakeCache.txt'.

3.4. BUILD CONFIGURATION TYPE ~
                                                    *cmake-options-build-type*
>
  let g:cmake_build_type = "Debug"

Defines the build configuration type to invoke CMake with. Some typical values
for this is DEBUG, RELEASE, and RELWITHDEBINFO.

3.5. INSTALLATION PREFIX ~
                                                    *cmake-options-install-prefix*
>
  let g:cmake_install_prefix = "$HOME/.local"

Defines the installation prefix at which the project will be installed at.

3.6. BUILD SHARED LIBRARIES ~
                                                    *cmake-options-build-shared-libs*
>
  let g:cmake_build_shared_libs = 1

Determines whether or not libraries will be built as shared libraries by
default.

3.7. BUILD SHARED LIBRARIES ~
                                                    *cmake-options-set-makeprg*
>
  let g:cmake_set_makeprg = 1

Determines whether or not the 'makeprg' value in Vim will be set to a tweaked
'make' where it builds using the files in your specified build directory.


4. METHODS

						    |cmake-methods|

There's a few methods binded to the editor for use of the developer. In the
future, some of these methods might be automatically mapped to the keyboard
within CMake files for easy use.

4.1 CREATING A BUILD
						    |cmake-methods-create-build| |:CMakeCreateBuild|

Invoking `:CMakeCreateBuild` does the following:

 + searches for 'CMakeLists.txt' recursively up the tree (fails if it can't).
 + uses the discovered directory to execute a initialization command for
   CMake.
