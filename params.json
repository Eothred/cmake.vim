{"name":"CMake Support for Vim","tagline":"Incorporates the functionality of CMake into Vim. Because it's AWESOME.","body":"# CMake Project Support in Vim\r\n[CMake](http://www.cmake.org) is the ONLY way you should be building your C or \r\nC++ projects. [Vim](http://www.vim.org) is the ultimate text editor. Together, \r\nalong with the power of gray skull, CMake support in Vim is born.\r\n\r\n[`cmake-support.vim`](https://github.com/jalcine/cmake-support.vim) is a Vim \r\nplugin that allows you to build your projects that are based on the CMake \r\nmeta-build system.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n> **NOTE**: This plugin has ONLY been tested on a bleeding edge version of Vim \r\n> 7.3 with `--features=huge`. Please report any problems you encounter with \r\n> version information and compilation options included.\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing, `cmake-support.vim` supports Vim 7.3+ and CMake \r\n2.8+. Have fun!\r\n\r\n## Installing\r\nI recommending using [Vundle](http://github.com/gmarik/vundle) to install \r\nplugins. The line necessary to add this plugin is as follows:\r\n\r\n```viml\r\nBundle 'jalcine/android-dev.vim'\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Commands\r\nSome of the more commonly used commands in the plugin include:\r\n\r\n  + `:CMakeBuild` - invokes `make install` from the path prescribed by CMake.\r\n\r\n## Options\r\nIn order for CMake to operate, it **has** to know where the build directory is \r\nlocated.\r\n","google":"UA-21819111-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
